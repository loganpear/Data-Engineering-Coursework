# Data Engineering Bootcamp Notes, Labs, & Projects  

Welcome to my Data Engineering Bootcamp repository! This repository contains my notes from lectures, code from labs, and course projects led by [Zach Wilson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eczachly/) as part of his free Data Engineering Bootcamp.  

## Purpose:
I'm taking this bootcamp on top of my Data Science coursework at Michigan State University to deepen my understanding of data engineering concepts and gain hands-on experience with practical tools and techniques. This bootcamp builds on the technical skills I’ve already learned and helps ensure that I’m well-prepared for my first professional data engineering role.  

### What You'll Find Here:  
- **Lecture Notes:** Key takeaways and concepts from each lecture.  
- **Lab Code:** Practical exercises and solutions for the labs, applying real-world data engineering techniques.  
- **Projects:** Hands-on projects designed to reinforce concepts and simulate tasks in a professional data engineering environment.

### Technologies and Tools:  
- **Docker:** Used to containerize applications and databases, ensuring consistency across different environments.  
- **DataGrip:** An IDE for managing and querying databases, enabling efficient SQL development and debugging.  
- **PostgreSQL:** A relational database management system used to design schemas, store data, and implement data pipelines.

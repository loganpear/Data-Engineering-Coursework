# Data Engineering Coursework
I'm taking this bootcamp on top of my Data Science coursework at Michigan State University to deepen my understanding of data engineering concepts and gain hands-on experience with practical tools and techniques.

### What You'll Find Here:  
- **Lecture Notes:** Key takeaways and concepts from each lecture.  
- **Lab Code:** Practical exercises and solutions for the labs, applying real-world data engineering techniques.  
- **Projects:** Hands-on projects designed to reinforce concepts and simulate tasks in a professional data engineering environment.

### Technologies and Tools:  
- **Docker:** Used to containerize applications and databases, ensuring consistency across different environments.  
- **DataGrip:** An IDE for managing and querying databases, enabling efficient SQL development and debugging.  
- **PostgreSQL:** A relational database management system used to design schemas, store data, and implement data pipelines.

**Bucketing:**
- Enhances query efficiency by grouping data into categories (e.g., age groups: 0-18, 19-25) to facilitate targeted analysis.
- Implemented using `CASE WHEN` statements to define bucket conditions.
- **Example:** Airbnb's "Superhost" status is determined by evaluating various criteria; hosts meeting high standards are classified as Superhosts, while others may be labeled as "Average Hosts."

**Cardinality:**
- Refers to the number of unique values in a dataset.
- **Examples:**
  - `user_id`: Unique cardinality (each ID is distinct).
  - `first_name`: High cardinality (many unique names, but some may repeat).
  - `gender`: Low cardinality (limited set of options, such as male, female, non-binary).

**Dimensions and Facts:**
- **Dimensions:**
  - Typically appear in `GROUP BY` clauses.
  - Represent categorical data used to slice and dice facts (e.g., date, product category).
- **Facts:**
  - Quantitative data often aggregated using functions like `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`.
  - Generally have higher volume compared to dimensions.

**SQL Integer Data Types:**
- **`INTEGER`:**
  - Suitable for most applications, such as counting rows or storing primary keys in smaller tables.
- **`BIGINT`:**
  - Ideal for very large numbers, like unique IDs in distributed systems or high-precision timestamps, especially when data volume may grow significantly over time.

*Note: Choosing the appropriate integer type is crucial for optimizing storage and performance.*
